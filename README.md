### Camera:
Control camera orientation using mouse, and move the camera using the keys ‘i’ and ‘k’ for z axis, ‘j’ and ‘l’ for x axis, and ‘y’
and ‘h’ for y axis. You can zoom using the scroll wheel on the mouse.

Press '-' on the Norwegian keyboard will alow you to switch between a camera that follows the glider in the scene and a free-moving camera.

### Glider:
The Glider can be controlled using the WASD keys. W and S makes a pitch movement where 'W' is downward and 'S' is upward. 'A'and 'D' rolls left and right respectively.

The camera that follows the glider does not follow properly, and is only oriented toward the original front of the plane.
